        <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          I am a Computer Science undergraduate student studying in Memorial University.
          I take a keen interest in pattern driven data analysis, beacuse to me its like solving puzzles with code.
          I am also quite interested in learning new languages and frameworks to build software applications, because who doesn't love being a jack of all trades, right?
          I enjoy working in teams and collaborating on projects, as it generally leads to new and weird ideas that I wouldn't have thought of on my own. Plus being in a team means I dont have to be lonely :) . 
          Lastly I am currently seeking internship opportunities where I can grow as a developer and tackle real world challenges as I believe the best way to learn in my field of study is by facing actual problems that take place in the industry.
